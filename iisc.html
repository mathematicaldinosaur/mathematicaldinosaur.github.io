    <h1>IISc CSA M.Tech research interview experience</h1>

    <p> 
        Hi, I’m Sreesankar. On May 13th 2025, I appeared for the research interview at IISc computer science
department. In this post you can nd my detailed interview experience and some preparation methods
I used for my interview.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Background</b>: After GATE results, IISc called for applications to research programmes. This includes
two programmes : M.Tech research and Phd. Selection procedure happened together for both of them.
On 16th April, I got the interview call letter, where they mentioned my interview date ( May 13 ). Few
days after that, the CS department circulated a google form - where we need to select a research sub
stream, two research sub areas, and two background subjects. A table attached below for reference:
    </p>
<img src="research areas.png" alt="Available research streams and areas" style="width:600px; border-radius:8px; margin:20px 0;">
<p>Please note that selection of substream is very important because you cannot change it once you are
admitted to the programme. But selection of sub area and background subject is only for the purpose
of interview. Since I am a theory lover, I selected Theoretical computer science. I selected
Combinatorics and Algorithms as my sub areas, Discrete math, Probability as background subjects.</p>
